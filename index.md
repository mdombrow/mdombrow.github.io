I hold a Master's degree in Demography from UC Berkeley, and a Bachelor’s Degree in History from

My sociology MA paper studies public discourse alluding to a “crisis of masculinity” in the U.S. 
using computational text analysis. Conceptualizing a relation (masculinity), through text, 
presents challenges. Drawing from Gail Biederman and Raewyn Connell, gender can be defined as a 
constant self-positioning, within a historical and dynamic contextual-terrain of power, 
production, and cathexis, whereby authority is claimed on the basis of having a particular kind 
of body. Masculinity is a set of relations within this terrain, which come with a constellation 
of historically-contingent practices. Masculinity is inherently prone to “crisis.” When relations 
are challenged, discursive work is done to “re-make” it.
